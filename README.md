## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Risheek

I'm a passionate cybersecurity student, currently building my skills in **network security, penetration testing, and automation.** I love working with **Kali Linux, Nmap, Wireshark, and Python for security tools** while also strengthening my **networking fundamentals (CCNA, Packet Tracer).**

- Fun fact: I love to fix and race cars (irl and virtual), calisthenics >> bodybuilding, and I touch grass. 
- Ask me about building PCs, setting up networks. If your Wi-Fi is acting up, Iâ€™m your person. Just donâ€™t ask me about untangling cables
- Iâ€™m currently learning advanced networking concepts, Python scripting for automation, and sharpening my skills in ethical hacking.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source cybersecurity projects/ CTF Team, especially related to penetration testing or network defense.
- Reach out to me on my Linkedin
