## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Risheek

I'm a passionate cybersecurity student, currently building my skills in **network security, penetration testing, and automation.** I love working with **Kali Linux, Nmap, Wireshark, and Python for security tools** while also strengthening my **networking fundamentals (CCNA, Packet Tracer).**

- âš¡ Fun fact: I rev engines (real and virtual) for fun, calisthenics >> bodybuilding, and I touch grass. Gotta balance the tech life with some fresh air!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about building PCs, setting up networks, or tech gadgets. If your Wi-Fi is acting up, Iâ€™m your person. Just donâ€™t ask me about untangling cables
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced networking concepts, Python scripting for automation, and sharpening my skills in ethical hacking.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source cybersecurity projects/ CTF Team, especially related to penetration testing or network defense.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can connect with me on my LinkedIn
